# Contact Management System (DSA Implementation)

This project demonstrates the practical application of multiple Data Structures to optimize performance.

## 🛠️ Data Structures Used
- **Hash Table**: Used for $O(1)$ instant lookup of contacts by name.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Allows for efficient $O(1)$ insertion and bidirectional (Forward/Backward) traversal.
- **Naive String Matching**: Implemented to allow searching for contacts via substrings.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Efficiency**: Lookups don't slow down as the list grows.
- **Directional Flexibility**: View your contacts from newest to oldest or vice versa.
- **Case-Insensitive Search**: Find "Adebayo" even if you only type "ade".

## 🖥️ How to Run
