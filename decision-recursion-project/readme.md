# 📂 Decision & Recursion Logic Lab 🧠

Welcome to the **Decision & Recursion Logic Lab**! This project is a curated collection of algorithmic solutions focusing on two fundamental pillars of Computer Science: **Conditional Decision Making** and **Recursive Problem Solving**.

---

## 🗺️ Project Structure

This project is organized into modular files to ensure clean separation of concerns and ease of review.

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `logic_tasks.js` | Contains `if-else` solutions for real-world decision logic. |
| `recursion_tasks.js` | Contains recursive functions with optimized base cases. |
| `test_logic.js` | The main execution script to verify all functions in the terminal. |

## 🚀 Features

### ⚖️ Decision Making Tasks

* **🎟️ Ticket Pricing:** A robust age-based logic system that determines movie ticket costs ($10, $15, or $20) using relational operators.
* **🌦️ Weather Clothing Adviser:** A multi-factor logic engine that combines temperature readings with precipitation status to provide personalized outfit recommendations.

### 🔄 Recursive Tasks

* **🧬 Fibonacci Sequence:** An elegant implementation of the  formula. It demonstrates the use of multiple base cases ( and ) to prevent infinite recursion.
* **↩️ Palindrome Checker:** A string-manipulation function that uses "Divide and Conquer" logic. It compares the "head" and "tail" of a string and shrinks the problem space recursively.
* *Note: Automatically handles capitalization and spacing.*

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

To run these tests on your local machine (VS Code / Terminal), follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download** the folder to your desktop.
2. **Open Terminal** and navigate to the folder:
```bash
cd decision-recursion-lab

```

3. **Execute the Test Runner** using Node.js:
```bash
node test_logic.js

```

## 🧪 Testing Results

The `test_logic.js` script provides instant feedback. You can expect to see output like this:

* ✅ **Ticket Pricing:** Success for all age brackets.
* ✅ **Weather Advice:** Correctly identifies rain gear requirements.
* ✅ **Fibonacci:** Accurately computes the  sequence value.
* ✅ **Palindrome:** Correctly identifies "Racecar" vs "Hello".
